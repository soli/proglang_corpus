Proglang Corpus
===============

This Python script will build a zip archive of some of the `most important
Github repositories <https://github.com/repositories>`_ using Github's `API
,<http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/>`_ to access the contents.
The files are then concatenated by programming language, as determined by
`Github's linguist repo <https://github.com/github/linguist/>`_.

The result is a corpus organized by programming languages and suitable fori,
training or evaluating keyboard layouts and other methods. All the code in the
corpus remains under its original copyright.

Requirements
------------

Both the excellent `requests <docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
package and `pyyaml <pyyaml.org>`_ library are necessary to run this script
(written for Python 3).
